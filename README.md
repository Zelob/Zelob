Hi, I’m @Zelob, Welcome to my GitHub page. Primarily you will see most class projects or small personal time projects here.
 ------------------------------------------------------
Student at the University of Auckland, studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering(EEE). (Yes, I code also) 

Looking to pick up small projects allowing me to learn and improve my ability to code. But also be able to broaden my horizons with different coding languages. 

You can reach me either at my Github Page or through Discord @arcticsaber
